        I love the sound of the net when it swishes.
        I love the rhythm of dribbling.
        I love having teammates.
        
        I love having coaches that support you.
        I love putting on a uniform.
        I love being part of the team huddle and cheer.
        I love playing in front of an audience.
        I love dropping all my thoughts to focus.
        
        I love being so winded that I can't even stand up straight.
        I love funny refs.
        I love cheering for my teammates.
        I love anticipating the next practice or game.
        And because of this, I love basketball."

        The first time I went snowboarding, I did not achieve anything besides rolling down the entire bunny hill at Glen Eden.
        However, the following winter it snowed roughly 50cm during the break and I was able to practice a lot. 
        Falling didn't even hurt because you landed in a foot of fluffy snow. 
        I fell
          in love with snowboarding for the adrenaline on the slopes and the amazing views. "

        text="
        After I injured my ACL, I realized I can not keep playing basketball without doing any strength training. After I healed,
          I focused mostly on squats, lunges, and jumps to target my knee strength and stability. During the summer of 2017, I also
          ran 3km four times a week to improve my endurance.
          Once I started university, I also started to lift weights.
          I enjoy pushing myself at the gym and seeing my reps and weights go up.
                   
          My best lift is bench pressing 105lb for 8 reps and my goal is to have a one rep max of 135lb.
