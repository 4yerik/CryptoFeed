          After I injured my ACL, I realized I can't keep playing basketball without doing any strength training. After I healed, 
          I focused mostly on squats, lunges, and jumps to target my knee strength and stability. During the summer of 2017, I also 
          ran 3km four times a week to improve my endurance. 
          <br></br><br></br>
          Once I started university, I also started to lift heavier weights. My focus transitioned from legs to core + arms. 
          During first year, I went to the gym 3 or 4 times a week and I continued that habit through my first coop term in Toronto. 
          My favourite exercises are push ups, pull ups, chin ups, bench presses, back squats, deadlifts, russian twists, and 
          overhead presses.

          I thought I had another season of basketball in my last year of high school but due to unforseen circumstances, I did not. 
          Although that left me very sad, it led me to fall in love with snowboarding. I had tried snowboarding once before 
          but did not achieve anything besides rolling down the entire bunny hill at Glen Eden. I saw some cool snowboarding videos 
          and decided I wanted to get better at snowboarding. That winter, it dumped snow during my winter break. I was outside for 
          8 hours at a time snowboarding. Falling didn't even hurt because you landed in a foot of fluffy snow. It 
          was awesome. I learned how to turn from toe side and heel side. I even learned how to not fall off the ski lift. I fell 
          in love with snowboarding. The adrenaline on the slopes and the amazing views were priceless. On top of all this, the 2018 
          Olympics were going on. Chloe Kim, who is basically my long lost sister, won Gold in Halfpipe! Shaun White killed it too!
